**Project Overview:**
Developed a full-stack web application named Hostel Hunt to facilitate the search and booking of hostels. The project utilizes a comprehensive technology stack including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js. Key functionalities include user authentication and authorization, RESTful APIs, custom error handling, data validation, an MVC architecture, interactive maps for hostel locations, and deployment using MongoDB Atlas and Render.

**Key Responsibilities and Achievements:**

- **Designed** and **developed** the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience.
- **Implemented** RESTful APIs for efficient communication between the front-end and back-end, adhering to REST principles for a standardized approach.
- **Integrated** MongoDB as the database solution to store and manage user data and hostel information, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- **Configured** Node.js and Express.js to create a robust back-end server, enabling efficient handling of requests and responses.
- **Applied** Passport.js for authentication and authorization, enhancing application security by managing user sessions and access control.
- **Developed** custom error handling middleware to manage and display meaningful error messages, improving debugging and user feedback.
- **Added** validation for both front-end forms and back-end data processing to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid or malicious input.
- **Structured** the application using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, promoting organized code and separation of concerns.
- **Integrated** Mapbox to display interactive maps for each hostel location, enhancing the user experience by providing visual context and easy navigation.
